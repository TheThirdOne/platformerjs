Pull Requests, Feature Requests and Contributions
--------------------------------------------------
Currently this project is in pre-alpha status and would be very difficult to contribute to unless you are in direct contact with me.
Documentation and build systems are a major area that I do not have skills in that could be improved though.
Feel free to create issues to discuss improvements for specific parts of the project. 
Pull requests will be quickly reviewed and merged if they align with the goal of the project.
